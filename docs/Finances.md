### How is money raised?

By creating software!

For example, an easy way to fundraise via Twitch, donation-funded open source utilities, affiliate links, etc.

### How is money spent?

Every penny is directly spent improving the lives of cats. Initially the most direct way will be purchasing items for specific cat rescue centres, but this might not be scalable!
