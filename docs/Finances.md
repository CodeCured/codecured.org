# Finances

Whilst most of Code Cured's impact will be through free service and information, money will likely end up being involved eventually.

## FAQs

### How is money raised?

By creating software!

For example, an easy way to fundraise via Twitch, donation-funded open source utilities, affiliate links, etc. Payments for hosting, domains, commissions etc will be funded by trustees or direct donations, never taken from general donations.

### How is money spent?

Every penny is directly spent improving the lives of cats. Initially the most direct way will likely be purchasing items for specific cat rescue centres, but this might not be scalable! 

## Current outgoings

These payments are *not* made using Code Cured money, but are still paid!
