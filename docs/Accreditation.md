## Accreditation

*Note: These are just "in progress" notes, not advice or recommendations for any other individual / group.*

### Summary

[Here's the main guide](https://www.gov.uk/set-up-a-charity), essentially: 

1. [Read the full guidance](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/557944/Apply_to_register_a_charity_questions.pdf) and prepare answers:
    1. Organisation's details
        1. Name: Code Cured The Cat
        2. Contact details: Use mine (use corporate postal address)
        3. Trustees: Name / address / DOB / email, and [complete the trustee doc](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/confirmation-of-charity-trustee-eligibility)
    2. Organisation's structure and purpose
        1. Fill in the "Governing Document" using foundation CIO commission doc (as a Google Doc).
        2. Fill in purposes of the charity (cat welfare).
        3. Who the organisation helps (cats, obviously).
        4. Where the organisation operates (primarily UK for now).
    3. Organisation's benefits
        1. Purpose (must match governing document).
        2. Who can benefit: N/A?
        3. Benefits of those involved: No services / facilities / benefits to anyone involved.
        4. Overseas aid: For now, significantly easier to restrict to UK-only.
    4. Organisation's money
        1. Income: For a CIO no bank account is needed, so can skip.
        2. Property: N/A.
        3. Tax relief: Gift aid, but can wait until after.
        4. Funding: Public donations only.

### What type of charity?

According to [this article](https://www.charityexcellence.co.uk/Home/BlogDetail?Link=How_to-register_a_charity) with [this table](https://www.slideshare.net/IanMclintock/charity-registration-infographic-online-guides), the main options are:

* **Unincorporated**: Easy, free, but not *really* a charity. Can do basic fundraising, but only possible if raising under £5k/yr.
* **Charitable companies**: Requires all the hassle of Companies House, AND Charity Commission. This used to be the main option so is very common. No point now.
* **Charitable trusts**: Half the hassle, no liability cover etc. An option, but "Almost nobody registers charitable trusts any longer" so should probably avoid.
* **Association model CIO**: Useful if a large pool of members who need to vote etc. That is not Code Cured.
* **Foundation model CIO**: Simpler, and "the vast majority of people opt for a CIO".

Based on this, it makes sense to start out **Unincorporated**, and work towards **Foundation model CIO** as Code Cured grows.

### Steps to unincorporated association

According to [this guide](https://www.charityexcellence.co.uk/Home/BlogDetail?Link=Unincorporated_Association_Toolkit), the 3 things needed are:

1. ✅ **A name**: Code Cured The Cat.
2. ❌ **A constitution**: Nope, but can use the "*Model constitution for a small charity*" template on [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/setting-up-a-charity-model-governing-documents).
3. ❌ **3 trustees**: Can't be anyone closely linked, there are listings of people willing to do this, but that should be a last resort.

It's important to note that this doesn't actually need to be registered *with* any part of the government, it just has to exist somewhere.

#### Constitution

This can be worked on ASAP.

#### Trustees 

Interestingly, despite everything online mentioning three trustees being a fixed requirement, the [official guidance on CIOs](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/charitable-incorporated-organisations/practice-guide-14a-charitable-incorporated-organisations#:~:text=1.3%20Constitution%20and%20trustees) actually says:

> A charitable incorporated organisation must have at least one trustee (section 206(2)(b) of the Charities Act 2011).

[Other resources](https://fcls.co.uk/a-guide-to-forming-a-charitable-incorporated-organisation-cio/) state:

> Usually, the Charity Commission would expect to see a minimum of two or three trustees, in the interests of transparency and good governance.

So, perhaps 3 trustees is highly recommended, but not actually essential. Since Code Cured's work is likely going to be done by anonymous online people worldwide, trustees are presumably less important. The simplest way to find out is likely to try and register!

### Steps to CIO

A lot of paperwork ([guide](https://www.charityexcellence.co.uk/Home/BlogDetail?Link=How_to-register_a_charity)), specifically 24 screens with 13 main sections(!).

Approval can take ~40 working days.
